I developed a Battleships game using JavaScript and HTML.

## I developed a Battleships game using JavaScript and HTML, utilizing grid-based layout for ship placement and user interface. JavaScript powered the game logic, including ship movement, hit detection, and win conditions. HTML provided structure and interactivity, making it accessible for players to enjoy strategic naval combat directly in their browser.
